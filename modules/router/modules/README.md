# NixOS Router Modules

This directory contains modular components of the NixOS router configuration. Each module handles a specific aspect of the router's functionality.

## Module Overview

### `router.nix`

**Core Networking** (Main router module)

- WAN interface configuration (DHCP or PPPoE)
- LAN bridge configuration (multiple isolated networks)
- Firewall and NAT rules
- Network isolation between bridges
- Port forwarding
- TCP/IP performance optimizations

**What it does:**

- Configures WAN connectivity (internet connection)
- Creates multiple LAN bridges with physical interface assignments
- Implements network segmentation and firewall rules
- Enables NAT for internet access
- Configures hardware offloading and TCP optimizations

### `dns.nix`

**DNS and DHCP Services (dnsmasq)**

- Recursive DNS resolver with caching
- DHCP server for dynamic IP assignment
- Ad-blocking and malware protection via blocklists
- Local domain support with wildcard DNS
- Integrated DHCP-DNS registration

**What it does:**

- Runs separate DNS and DHCP instances for HOMELAB and LAN networks
- Listens on bridge interfaces (ports 53 for DNS, 67 for DHCP)
- Resolves local domains (_.homelab.local, _.lan.local)
- Forwards DNS queries to upstream servers
- Assigns IP addresses to devices via DHCP
- Automatically registers DHCP clients in DNS
- Blocks ads and malware via daily-updated blocklists
- Provides DNS entries: domain, \*.domain, and router.domain
- Supports static DHCP reservations

### `dhcp.nix`

**Legacy DHCP Configuration (Deprecated)**

- This module is no longer used
- DHCP functionality has been moved to `dns.nix` (dnsmasq)
- Kept for reference only

### `webui.nix` **NEW!**

**Modern Web Dashboard (FastAPI + React)**

- Real-time monitoring via WebSockets
- PostgreSQL database for historical data and configuration (DNS, DHCP, Apprise, notifications)
- Celery + Redis for background tasks (aggregation, notifications, port scanner, history cleanup)
- System user authentication (PAM + JWT)
- Flowbite React interface

**What it does:**

- Provides web-based monitoring and configuration management at http://router-ip:8080
- **Monitoring:** System metrics (CPU, memory, load, uptime), live bandwidth per interface (WAN, HOMELAB, LAN), DHCP client list, service status (dnsmasq DNS/DHCP, PPPoE), device usage, speedtest, logs
- **Configuration management:** DHCP (networks, static reservations), DNS (zones, records), CAKE traffic shaping, Apprise services, Dynamic DNS, port forwarding, blocklists and whitelist
- Stores historical metrics for trend analysis; automatic database cleanup (configurable retention)
- Mobile-responsive design with dark mode support

**Key features:**

- FastAPI backend with Python data collectors; Celery workers and Redis for background jobs and caching
- React + TypeScript frontend with Flowbite components
- WebSocket-based real-time updates
- PostgreSQL with automatic migrations

See `../webui/README.md` for full documentation.

### `dashboard.nix`

**Legacy Monitoring and Metrics**

- Grafana: Web-based monitoring dashboard (port 3000)
- Prometheus: Metrics collection and storage
- Node Exporter: System and network metrics
- Speedtest: Periodic internet speed tests

**What it does:**

- Provides real-time monitoring of router performance
- Collects CPU, memory, network, and disk metrics
- Runs automated speed tests every 6 hours
- Creates visualizations for network traffic and system health

**Note:** Consider using `webui.nix` instead for a more modern interface.

### `linode-dyndns.nix`

**Dynamic DNS Updates**

- Automatic IP address detection
- Linode DNS record updates via API
- Change detection and logging
- Configurable update intervals

**What it does:**

- Monitors public IP address changes
- Updates Linode DNS records automatically
- Runs every 5 minutes to keep DNS in sync
- Logs all IP changes to system journal

### `users.nix`

**User Account Management**

- Creates system user account
- Configures sudo privileges
- Auto-login on console
- Password synchronization with sops secrets

**What it does:**

- Sets up the router administrator account
- Enables passwordless sudo for admin user
- Automatically logs in admin user on boot
- Syncs password from encrypted secrets

### `secrets.nix`

**Secrets Management (sops-nix)**

- User password (required)
- PPPoE credentials (conditional)
- Linode API token (conditional)

**What it does:**

- Manages encrypted secrets using age encryption
- Automatically generates encryption key on first boot
- Makes secrets available to system services
- Only enables secrets that are needed based on configuration

## Adding New Modules

When creating a new module:

1. Create a `.nix` file in this directory
2. Import it in `../configuration.nix`
3. Keep it focused on a single responsibility
4. Use `routerConfig` from `../router-config.nix` for user-configurable values
5. Document what it does in this README

## Module Dependencies

```
configuration.nix
├── hardware-configuration.nix (generated by nixos-generate-config)
└── modules/
    ├── secrets.nix (loaded early for sops encryption)
    ├── users.nix (depends on secrets)
    ├── router.nix (core networking, creates bridges)
    ├── dns.nix (depends on router bridges, handles both DNS and DHCP)
    ├── dhcp.nix (deprecated, kept for reference only)
    ├── webui.nix (optional, modern monitoring dashboard)
    ├── dashboard.nix (optional, legacy monitoring with Grafana)
    └── linode-dyndns.nix (optional, depends on secrets)
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep modules independent**: Avoid circular dependencies between modules
- **Use conditionals**: Enable features only when needed (see `secrets.nix`)
- **Document configuration**: Add comments explaining non-obvious settings
- **Test changes**: Always test in a VM before deploying to production
- **Follow NixOS conventions**: Use standard service options when available
